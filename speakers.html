        <p>Douglas Crockford was born in the wilds of Minnesota, but left when he was only six months old because it was just too damn cold. He turned his back on a promising career in television when he discovered computers. He has worked in learning systems, small business systems, office automation, games, interactive music, multimedia, location-based entertainment, social systems, and programming languages. He is the inventor of Tilton, the ugliest programming language that was not specifically designed to be an ugly programming language. He is best known for having discovered that there are good parts in JavaScript. This was an important and unexpected discovery. He also discovered the JSON Data Interchange Format, the world's most loved data format. And he works at PayPal.</p>
        <h2>Syntaxation</h2>
        <p>Much of programming language design is dictated by fashion. As a consequence, opinions about programming languages tend to be strong, shallow, and deeply emotional. The best languages are brilliant and sadly unfashionable. But we love our stylish, over-rated syntax, and this talk presents an amazing parsing technique that helps achieve it.</p>

        <h2>Categorizing values: typeof, instanceof and beyond</h2>
        <p>You have probably heard of two common ways of categorizing values in JavaScript: typeof and instanceof. In this talk, we briefly review the basics of this kind of categorization and then move on to quirks and advanced topics: primitive values versus objects; typeof and instanceof (and their quirks); the internal property [[Class]]; the odd nature of the prototypes of built-in constructors; and more.</p>

        <p>I make a living evaluating new technologies, coaching our employees and having an eye on the overall code quality.</p>

        <p>I also write a lot of code - either for our open source tools or internal projects or in my free time, just for the fun of it. </p>

        <p>Our company has been developing web sites and web applications as well as mobile applications for iOS and Android for many years now.</p>
        
        <p>The recent step to dump pure-native iOS and Android development in favour of HTML 5 + Javascript + CSS 3 hybrid apps was a tough but fruitful one.</p>

        <p>There are many different options to pick from, many decisi  ons to make and various roadbumps you're likely to run into.</p>

        <p>The talk sums up the most important questions you'll need to answer, talks about a few potential problems and solutions for them as well as giving an example stack, that allows you to generate the mobile app along with a "normal" web application.

        <h2>Introduction to NoSQL with Couchbase</h2>
        <p>This presentation starts wtith a generic introduction to NoSQL; and explains the reasons why more and more projects are using NoSQL databases. Tug will also talk about the different solution such as Key/Value, Documents, Columns and Graphs datastore.</p>

After this introduction you will see how Couchbase 2.0, an Open Source Document database works and see how it helps the developers to be more productive. During this presentation you will see:
* how to use JSON Databases using Node.js
* use map reduce function, written in Javascript on V8 Engine, to create secondary index based on JSON attributes
* how to scale and monitor a cluster to let your application grows with your application success.

During this presentation Tugdual will do demonstration based on Couchbase, Node and AngularJS to show the benefits of Javascript & JSON from client to server to database and how flexible schema/schemaless NoSQL databases empower the developer.

        <h2>Programming the Real World: Javascript for Makers</h2>
        <p>Cheap electronics components have opened up a whole new world of invention.  You can buy a wireless circuit board the size of a quarter and a pocket-sized computer running Linux for under $100.  This puts real-life projects in the price range of millions of innovators: robots, home automation, DIY satellites, and more.<p/>
        <p>
        Javascript is a great language for these projects, because of its efficient runtimes, widespread use, rich libraries, and web roots.  I'll share my experiences working with two hardware projects, including the value that software developers bring to a hardware projects.  Finally, I'll show how to get involved in an existing hardware project or start your own.</p>

        <p>The representation of JavaScript programs that Mozilla used when they exposed their SpiderMonkey reflection API isn't perfect; in fact, it has a good number of flaws. But a rich ecosystem of tools has formed around this particular structured representation of JavaScript programs, most notably the popular esprima parser. </p><p>The reusability and composability of these tools has made this format the standard for all modern projects that transform, generate, or otherwise work with JavaScript programs. We will explore this burgeoning format, evaluate its design with the benefit of hindsight, and showcase some of the more useful and prominent projects that have adopted it.</p>

        <p>Computer Graphics, particularly 3D, is a discipline of computer science with decades of tradition and research behind it. As we keep struggling to master the world of 3D rending on the desktop, a whole new world of possibilities is now arising on the web thanks to the WebGL Javascript APIs, which allow us to harness the full power of a computer's graphics stack from inside the DOM.

      WebGL is now more relevant than ever, and there's a lot of people attempting 3D on the browser with Three.js and other frameworks, most often with poor results: Not because these frameworks are not good, but because the users don't understand the underlying concepts and abstractions behind them.
      
      This talk is a gentle and practical introduction to the concept of low-level 3D rendering, exposed through a web browser and the lens of Javascript with WebGL.
      
      Javascript *is* a real programming language. That means Javascript engineers have a responsibility, a necessity to understand the underlying computer science behind the technologies they use, even if they are abstracted behind a framework. We *need* to understand how to go all the way from Javascript to vertexes on our GPU if we want 3D on the web to truly catch up with 3D on the desktop.
      
      Let's do some real engineering with Javascript.

        <p>Vicent Marti has a name which is difficult to pronounce. Despite his main occupation as intergalactic MC, he spends his spare time working full time at GitHub, where he builds tools for the people who build the Internet.

        <p>Talk presented by 2 Frontend Web Developers from Spotify: Jose Pérez and Tomás Pérez, based in Stockholm.</p>
        <p>They love to learn and play with new web technologies, specially focused into HTML5, Mobile Web and Web Performance Optimization.</p>

        <h2>Cross-platform application development using web technologies</h2>
        <p>This talk presents how Spotify uses web technologies to develop and maintain key features in the different platforms that compose the Spotify experience: desktop client, mobile apps and the Web Player.</p>

        <p>Hybrid apps is a hot topic nowadays, and we will explain how our architecture abstracts a web developer from the platform, making it possible to share code across multiple devices.</p>

        <p>In addition, we will talk about how we communicate with the Spotify clients, using web technologies such as local storage to communicate between different tabs and post messages to achieve cross domain communication. We will also analyze some browser inconsistencies and will show work-arounds to solve them.</p>

        <p>Stuart is a web developer living and working in Glasgow, Scotland. A self-proclaimed "champion of the future", he spends much of his time experimenting with HTML5 and the Web Audio API. These experiments usually result in projects with silly names. - <a href="http://stuartmemo.com/qwerty-hancock/" target="_blank">http://stuartmemo.com/qwerty-hancock/</a></p>

      <p>Last year, he gave one of the most popular talks at JSConf EU, declaring that JavaScript is the new Punk Rock. - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN8Eg1K9xjE" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN8Eg1K9xjE</a></p>
        
        <h2>The Amazing Sounds of JavaScript</h2>
        <p>From the theremin to the sampler via the synthesizer and drum machine, technology has always shaped the sound of popular music. While the web has become the most popular way of sharing music, it’s never been used to make it. That is until now. The Web Audio API enables us to design and create instruments & audio effects from scratch using JavaScript. This talk will not only show you how to do this, but why this is the future of making music.</p>
