    <span class="title">Intergalactic Javascript Robots from Outer Space</span>

    <div class="description"><span class="difficulty intermediate">intermediate</span>

      <p>GitHub, the largest source
        code host in the world, has over 70 employees spread all over the planet, and a rather unique workflow.
        Managing a distributed team of that size presented challenges that no other companies had faced before.
        That's why we did the only thing that made sense: we built a robot, in Javascript, running on Node, and we
        let it run our company.

        This is the story of Hubot, our intergalactic butler, who takes care of our whole application stack
        (including deploying code to production, which we do up to 20 times a day), manages our office, keeps track
        of all our employees and looks up pictures of pink ponies and cute dogs. All at the same time.

        We felt that Hubot was so awesome that every other company deserved having one, so we open-sourced it for
        everybody. If you're still not using Hubot, in this talk you'll learn how our robot from outer space can
        change the way your company works -- for the better.</p>

      <p>Nowadays developers are flooded with
        various libraries which are supposed to help and speed up the development process but often proove to be
        counterproductive. Same with design processes - designers are trapped with styles and hypes which they use
        without thinking. This talk is more inspirational, and it's aim is to show good practices within processes,
        emphasize the importance of decisions made within them and how they impact whole projects. It will also
        compare some frameworks and libraries available and point out which one of them are useful in which use

    <span class="title">Writing RESTful web services with node.js</span>

    <div class="description"><span class="difficulty beginner">beginner</span>

      <p>Tools like Express and NoSQL-databases
        have made it easy to write web applications using Node.js. But what if we don't need to serve HTML? What if we
        don't need to do templating, CSS and pretty animations? What if we only want to provide an HTTP-interface to our
        data?

        This talk will be about tips and tricks for building RESTful web services using Node.js. It'll discuss
        challenges,
        pitfalls and shortcuts. It will deal with authentication, declarative ways to describe your data structures and
        validation.

        If you're serious about building a backend able to serve any kind of application or provide a public API for
        your
        users, and doing it without pain, this is a talk for you.</p>

    <div class="description"><span class="difficulty advanced">advanced</span>

      <p>First we will take some time to understand the GildedRose kata and point out a list of possible improvements.
        We will also try to sort the list depending on their priority for our goal.

        Then we will start working on them by covering the existing code with tests and applying the improvements
        iteratively, making the smallest possible change each time and checking that everything works on the way.

        We will finish the dojo by creating some unit tests (or specs) that will help us to detect and shape the core
        responsibilities of the components of the application. </p>

      <p>You should come to the workshop with a laptop and these resources:</p>

    years I worked at Amazon.com. I learned a lot there since before taking that job I made my living doing research in
    Oceanography. I have experience with web development, operations, web services, localization and international
    launches of major products. I have worked in some of the bigest websites of the world but also devoted time to
    create web site frameworks that go big and small. On 2010 I joined tuenti.com, a social network in Spain with over
    thirteen million registered users. For most of my time at tuenti I have worked in PHP. I have recently changed my
    focus in tuenti from mobile to Javascript to deal with the client-side performance issues we were having.

    <span class="title">Client side rendering is not so easy</span>

    <div class="description"><span class="difficulty intermediate">intermediate</span>

      <p>Our early attempts at doing client side rendering in tuenti.com brought us many performance problems, not only
        for the usual offenders (IE6 and IE7) but also for fast browsers like Chrome. We tried to solve most of those
        using a technology to render client side that ended up being faster on IE7 than Chrome, but still, things were
        not working. We had to scrape most of our homegrown framework and start from the beginning. We realized that the
        first thing we needed to do to use Javascript successfully in our thick client was to have a Javascript
        dependency management system. YUI came to our rescue. We also learned that in our case we would not be able to
        work only with client-side rendering, having server-side rendering was a must. That brings the problem of what
        template engine to use and whether to render server side with PHP or rather use Javascript and node so you can
        truly share templates between server and client. We will talk about the mistakes we made early on so you can
        learn from those, but also about technologies and methodologies that have (and have not) worked for us.</p>

    academic exploration. As a result my implementations tend to be less glamorous, but are more realistic
    representations of what you would see in real-world development.

        But what happens when you need to support server side rendering for SEO, or support clients without JavaScript

    <div class="description"><span class="difficulty beginner">beginner</span>

      <p>Roy is a statically-typed, functional programming language that
        compiles to JavaScript. It has features from languages such as ML and
        Haskell: type-inference, algebraic data-types, pattern matching,
        structural typing and do-notation. Its aim is to make writing
        JavaScript safer by improving reasoning.</p>
